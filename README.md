##INSTALLATION AND STARTING UP  

Download these files and go the folder.  
Because of security reasons most modern browsers do not just play a HTML file.  
There are several ways of serving files in localhost, but one way to do it by writing
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
to your terminal and go to address: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
